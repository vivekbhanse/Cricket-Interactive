Overview
This mobile app project demonstrates the use of Jetpack Compose for building a UI that consumes data from two APIs dynamically and displays match details, squads, and team details.

The application consists of two main screens:

Screen 1: Displays match details, including team names, match date-time, and venue details, with navigation to the second screen.
Screen 2: Displays the squads of two teams, with filtering options for team players, highlights for captains and wicketkeepers, and alerts displaying batting and bowling styles when tapping on a player.
